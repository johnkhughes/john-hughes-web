Here is an excellent tip from Sebastian Ekström on [vertical aligning elements with CSS](http://zerosixthree.se/vertical-align-anything-with-just-3-lines-of-css/). It even works when you don’t know how tall they are. Thanks to [SitePoint Versioning](http://www.sitepoint.com/versioning/) for sharing the link.
