excerpt: Microsoft has announced that Internet Explorer 10 will not run on versions of Windows older than Windows 7. Unfortunately, this is just another browser testing headache for us web developers.

Microsoft has announced that Internet Explorer 10 will [only run on Windows 7](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/04/12/native-html5-first-ie10-platform-preview-available-for-download.aspx) (and, presumably, Windows 8). That means that users of older versions of Windows are stuck with IE9. Unless they are one of the 50 per cent or so of web users running Windows XP, in which case they have to use IE8. That means that even “best case” browser testing, where you assume everyone is using the latest available version of a mainstream browser, will soon mean testing in three different versions of Internet Explorer. A lot of the time, you can’t even assume that. I’m still testing in IE7 and, yes, IE6. Soon, I will be testing in more versions of IE than all the other browsers put together. Even in my “best case” scenario, I can’t assume support for any HTML5 or CSS3 at all. The “[Beauty of the Web](http://www.beautyoftheweb.com/)”? Not yet. Thanks Microsoft.
