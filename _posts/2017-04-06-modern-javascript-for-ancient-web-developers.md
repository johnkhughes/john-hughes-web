I really enjoyed reading [Modern JavaScript for Ancient Web Developers](https://trackchanges.postlight.com/modern-javascript-for-ancient-web-developers-58e7cae050f9) by [Gina Trapani](http://ginatrapani.org/). And it's not just for the ancients---there are so many useful points and links, even an experienced front end developer could learn a lot from it.
