Katie Sherwin at Nielsen Norman Group has posted a great explanation of why [placeholders should never be used as replacements for labels](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/form-design-placeholders/) in form fields. Thanks to [James Young](https://twitter.com/welcomebrand/status/466141808519442432) for sharing the link.
