Voyager 1 has become the first object made by humans to [leave the solar system](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/voyager/voyager20130912.html). It is still transmitting useful data more than 36 years after it was launched. It is an astonishing achievement. Our species has walked on the Moon, our probes have travelled to the planets of our solar system, and our rovers crawl over the surface of Mars. But this should be just the beginning: we have to keep going.
