[You Might Not Need JavaScript](http://youmightnotneedjs.com/) demonstrates some clever, and some less well known, HTML and CSS techniques that might just make some of your JavaScript redundant. Together with [You Might Not Need jQuery](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/), it shows just how much you can do with web standards in a modern browser. Worth remembering!
