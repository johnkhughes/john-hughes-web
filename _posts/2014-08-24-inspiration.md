excerpt: Anno Dracula by Kim Newman is a great book, extending Bram Stoker's world to create something entirely new and thoroughly entertaining. I loved it. It also made me think about how inspiration should work, whether you are writing a novel or designing a website.

I have just finished Anno Dracula by Kim Newman and I really enjoyed it. I am a big fan of the Bram Stoker's original and I was a little nervous that Newman's book would intrude on and detract from the original. But various recommendations persuaded me to try it and I am very glad they did.

I do not want to give anything away, but I will say that Newman has not written a straight sequel and he has not attempted to emulate Stoker's style. Anno Dracula is an entirely separate work, extending and expanding on Stoker's world, adding new characters and its own individual flair.

It made me think about my own work on the web and how I am inspired by other designers and developers. It often feels like I am making bad copies of superior sites. But Anno Dracula is a model of how inspiration should work: an extension and expansion, respectful and affectionate, but ultimately something entirely new.
