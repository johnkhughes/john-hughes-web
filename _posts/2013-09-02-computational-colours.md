This is a great post on [generating colour palettes](http://devmag.org.za/2012/07/29/how-to-choose-colours-procedurally-algorithms/) by Dev Mag. I have been looking for something like this for years. Thanks to [Patrick H. Lauke](https://twitter.com/patrick_h_lauke) and [Daniel Davis](https://twitter.com/ourmaninjapan) for sharing the link on Twitter.
