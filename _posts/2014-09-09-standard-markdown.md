Markdown is a great way of writing HTML, but every implementation is slightly different. But perhaps not any more. [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org/) aims to prepare a definite Markdown syntax that can be used anywhere. Now Markdown is being used everywhere from [README files](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown) to [content management systems](http://grabaperch.com/), this can only be a good thing.

**Update (9 Sep 2014):** CommonMark was originally known as [Standard Markdown](http://standardmarkdown.com/). The [name was changed at the request of John Gruber](http://blog.codinghorror.com/standard-markdown-is-now-common-markdown/), the original creator of Markdown. I have updated the text and link here with the new name and URL.
