I spotted a link to [Chris Ferdinandi's post on ditching jQuery](http://gomakethings.com/ditching-jquery) recently and I really enjoyed reading it. It reminded me of [You Might Not Need jQuery](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/) and [You Might Not Need jQuery Plugins](http://youmightnotneedjqueryplugins.com/), both of which are excellent resources for writing vanilla JavaScript. I often end up using jQuery for simple tasks, but the potential impact on performance makes native JavaScript look a lot more attractive.
