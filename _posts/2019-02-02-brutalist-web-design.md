David Bryant Copeland has coined the phrase [brutalist web design](https://brutalist-web.design/) to describe what I have been thinking of for a while as a [mostly default](/2015/05/mostly-default/) approach. He explains it better than I could, but at its core is the principle that HTML on its own provides usability, accessibility, and speed and that we should think carefully before we change or even remove these benefits.
