Since I started making websites, I have been building up a list of useful tools, scripts, and other bits of software that just make my job a little bit easier. This is my current list.

<dl>
    <dt><a href="http://colorschemedesigner.com/">Color Scheme Designer 3</a></dt>
    <dd>An invaluable tool for finding complementary shades and colours, with a good range of options and a simple interface.</dd>
    <dt><a href="http://csslint.net/">CSS Lint</a></dt>
    <dd>A <a href="http://mattwilcox.net/archive/entry/id/1054/">controversial choice</a>, but still something I use regularly. You don’t have to do everything it says, but it will pick up errors and it might just make your code a bit more efficient. Always read the label.</dd>
    <dt><a href="http://checkip.dyndns.org/">Current IP Check</a></dt>
    <dd>Does exactly what it says it does.</dd>
    <dt><a href="http://whois.domaintools.com/">DomainTools WHOIS Lookup</a></dt>
    <dd>There are plenty of options for WHOIS queries, but I have always found this one the quickest and simplest.</dd>
    <dt><a href="http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/">Down For Everyone Or Just Me</a></dt>
    <dd>Also available at <a href="http://www.isup.me/">isup.me</a>, this simple site will save a lot of shouting across the office.</dd>
    <dt><a href="http://dummyimage.com/">Dynamic Dummy Image Generator</a></dt>
    <dd>Have you ever needed a dummy image to fill a gap in hurry? This generator is quick and simple and even prints the dimensions on the image, so you can remember what they are later.</dd>
    <dt><a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/">Font Squirrel</a></dt>
    <dd>Not really a single tool, this is a great resource for finding open source web fonts. The brilliantly flexible <code>@font-face</code> generator has also made a lot of projects a lot easier.</dd>
    <dt><a href="http://lint.brihten.com/html/">HTML Lint</a></dt>
    <dd>You know your code is valid, but is it pretty?</dd>
    <dt><a href="http://www.htaccesstools.com/htpasswd-generator/">htpasswd generator</a></dt>
    <dd>If you don’t have time to do it yourself, this can quickly add a bit of security to your site.</dd>
    <dt><a href="http://ismyblogworking.com/">Is My Blog Working?</a></dt>
    <dd>This site checks your blog for errors, efficiency, and visibility. More useful than you might think.</dd>
    <dt><a href="http://www.jshint.com/">JSHint</a></dt>
    <dd>A friendlier cousin of the venerable <a href="http://www.jslint.com/">JSLint</a>, this code checker has plenty of options and provides really useful feedback on your JavaScript code.</dd>
    <dt><a href="http://shancarter.com/data_converter/">Mr Data Converter</a></dt>
    <dd>What if you have some comma-delimited data that need to be in an HTML table, or a PHP array, or a JSON string, or something else entirely? Job done.</dd>
    <dt><a href="http://pxtoem.com/">PXtoEM.com</a></dt>
    <dd>Put away the calculator. This site converts your old-fashioned <code>px</code> units to shiny, responsive <code>em</code> units.</dd>
    <dt><a href="http://www.benjaminkeen.com/misc/bricss/">Responsive Design Test Bookmarklet</a></dt>
    <dd>Still endlessly resizing the window to test your responsive design? Stop that. You can also use <a href="http://mattkersley.com/responsive/">Matt Kersley’s</a> version, but personally I find the bookmarklet more convenient.</dd>
    <dt><a href="http://validator.nu/">Validator.nu</a></dt>
    <dd>The original and best HTML5 validator.</dd>
</dl>
    
And that is my list.
