Jeremy Keith makes an excellent point about [progressive enhancement](https://adactio.com/journal/7774) and properly identifying the core function of a site. It can be easy to get hung up on a single tool (e.g. a camera) and forget about what you actually want to achieve (e.g. an image). Sometimes you just need to take a step back and ask “Just what is it that you want to do?”.
