A lot of people grumble about WordPress. It’s old, it’s everywhere, and it’s written in deeply unfashionable PHP. But whatever you think about it, the really remarkable thing is that it exists at all. Thanks to [Automattic](http://automattic.com/), we all benefit from a free, open source platform we can use however we want. Just something to think about next time you feel like complaining about it.
