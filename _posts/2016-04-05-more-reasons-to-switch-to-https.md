There are lots of good reasons to switch to HTTPS. It protects your users and your site from third-party interference, it lets you use the much faster HTTP/2 protocol, and it might even give you a little SEO boost. For more details, and even more reasons to switch, check out [Scott Helme's recent post on HTTPS](https://scotthelme.co.uk/still-think-you-dont-need-https/). And, thanks to [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), switching to HTTPS is now both free and extremely easy.
