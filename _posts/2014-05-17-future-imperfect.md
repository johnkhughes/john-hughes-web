I don’t update this site very often. I am easily distracted, I don’t have much time, and inspiration can be hard to find. But the real reason is a lack of confidence. I want to write perfect posts, but instead I write nothing at all. Obviously, this is getting me nowhere. At [DotYork](http://dotyork.com/) a few weeks ago, [Rachel Shillcock](http://www.rachil.li/) talked about fear and shared this quote from J. M. Barrie:

> The moment you doubt whether you can fly, you cease for ever to be able to do it.

She’s dead right. I don’t intend anything so ambitious as flying, but I would like to write more and post more often. And so you can expect more frequent updates, a more relaxed tone, and considerably lower editorial standards from me from now on.
