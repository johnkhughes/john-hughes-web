Nobody wants to make websites for Internet Explorer 6, but unfortunately we do not always have a choice. For a while now, I have been keeping a list of CSS 2.1 features absent in Internet Explorer 6 as a quick reference when Iâ€™m putting a new stylesheet together. If you have not already given up developing for this dinosaur of a browser, perhaps you too will find it useful.
