Jon Yablonski has written some really good [front-end principles for designers](http://jonyablonski.com/2015/front-end-principles-for-designers/). A good design process benefits everyone: designers, developers, and users. Thanks to [Brad Frost](http://bradfrost.com/) for sharing the link on Twitter.
