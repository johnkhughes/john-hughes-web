Hello. My name is John Hughes and I am a web developer living in York in the UK. This is my personal site where I write about web design and development and anything else I find interesting. It is also where I experiment with new design ideas and code. I probably update the code more than I update the content, so expect frequent changes and more than a few rough edges.

I work at [Castlegate IT][1], a friendly web design and development company in the middle of York. I am pretty good with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I also get involved in everything from design to WordPress development to server administration. I care about web standards, accessibility, and open technologies and I always enjoy learning new things. I used to describe myself as self-taught, but really I have learned from lots of great developers here and elsewhere on the web.

Before I stumbled into a career in web development, I was a plant scientist and ecologist and I am still interested in the environment and all things biological. If you are really interested in my scientific exploits, you can read my published work [here][2], [here][3], [here][4], and [here][5]. More than anything else, my abrupt change of career has taught me that the ability to restart a router will gain you more respect than work on climate change. I also worked on a sheep farm in Wales, where there were no routers or science, but lots and lots of climate.

If you have a question or comment about the site, please [get in touch][6]. You can also find me on [GitHub][7] and [Twitter][8].
